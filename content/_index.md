### Overall
**Amazon RDS for SQL Server** is a fully managed database service that allows you to easily set up, operate, and scale SQL Server deployments in the cloud. With Amazon RDS, you can deploy multiple versions and editions of SQL Server in minutes with cost-efficient and re-sizable compute capacity.

In this workshop, participants will learn how to set up Amazon RDS for SQL Server, configure the instance, explore different backup strategies, secure the instance, and understand scaling and performance monitoring techniques.
